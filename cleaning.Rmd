This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
install.packages('usmap')

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(usmap)
library(leaflet)
library(plotly)

SB_raw <- read.csv("directory.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
unique(SBUSA_raw$State.Province)

SBUSA_raw = filter(SB_raw, Country == "US")
SBUSA_raw$Country = NULL
write.csv(SBUSA_raw, "SBUSA_raw.csv")
head(SBUSA_raw)

plot_usmap(color = "black")



```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
